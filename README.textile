h1. Shopify Rubygem

* Currently Read-only. Read any kind of data from Shopify, but no support built-in to save data back to Shopify.
* Connect to multiple shops in the same app.
* Thread-safe.

Example Usage:

<pre>
	shop = Shopify.new('store_name', 'api-key', 'api-secret', 'auth-token')

	order = shop.orders(:limit => 1)[0] # => gets first order

  order.line_items # => the line items within that order

	order.fulfillments # => gets all fulfillments related to this order

	blogs = shop.blogs # => gets all blogs for this shop

	articles = blogs[0].articles # => gets all the articles in this blog

	articles[0].comments # => gets the comments for that article

	shop.products # => get all products in this shop

	... and much more ... :)

</pre>
